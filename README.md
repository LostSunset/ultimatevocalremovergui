## Branch Details

This branch is branch is meant for AMD GPU support. 

- This code works with:
   - VR Arch
   - MDX-Net & MDX23C
   - Demucs (v3 & v4 only)

- Current issues:
   - The GPU memory cache does not clear the same way it can with Cuda, so running ensembles might be difficult unless you have a lot of V-RAM.
   - The MDX23C models might not handle segment sizes above 256 with OpenCL using 8GB of video memory (V-RAM).
   - Some VR 5.1 & Demucs v3 models might run slower with OpenCL. 

## About

This application uses state-of-the-art source separation models to remove vocals from audio files. UVR's core developers trained all of the models provided in this package (except for the Demucs v3 and v4 4-stem models).

## Installation

These bundles contain the UVR interface, Python, PyTorch, and other dependencies needed to run the application effectively. No prerequisites are required.

### Windows Installation

- Please Note:
    - This installer is intended for those running Windows 10 or higher. 
    - Application functionality for systems running Windows 7 or lower is not guaranteed.
    - Application functionality for Intel Pentium & Celeron CPUs systems is not guaranteed.
    - You must install UVR to the main C:\ drive. Installing UVR to a secondary drive will cause instability.

- Download the UVR installer for Windows via the link below:

### Manual Windows Installation

- Download and extract the repository [here](https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
- Download and install Python [here](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.8/python-3.9.8-amd64.exe)
   - Make sure to check "Add python.exe to PATH" during the install
- Run the following commands from the extracted repo directory:

```
python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have a compatible Nvidia GPU, run the following command:

```
python.exe -m pip install --upgrade torch --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
```

If you do not have FFmpeg or Rubber Band installed and want to avoid going through the process of installing them the long way, follow the instructions below.

**FFmpeg Installation**

- Download the precompiled build [here](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip)
- From the archive, extract the following file to the UVR application directory:
   - ```ffmpeg-5.1.2-essentials_build/bin/ffmpeg.exe```

**Rubber Band Installation**

In order to use the Time Stretch or Change Pitch tool, you'll need Rubber Band.

- Download the precompiled build [here](https://breakfastquay.com/files/releases/rubberband-3.1.2-gpl-executable-windows.zip)
- From the archive, extract the following files to the UVR application directory:
   - ```rubberband-3.1.2-gpl-executable-windows/rubberband.exe```
   - ```rubberband-3.1.2-gpl-executable-windows/sndfile.dll```

### Linux Installation (Updated Instructions)

<details id="LinuxInstall">
  <summary>See Linux Installation Instructions</summary>

<br />

**These installation instructions are for Debian & Arch-based Linux systems.**

---

#### **Step 1: Download the Repository**
- Download and save this repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
- Extract the downloaded file to a directory of your choice.

---

#### **Step 2: Install Dependencies**
Use the following commands based on your system type:

**For Debian-based systems (Ubuntu, Mint, etc.):**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg python3-pip python3-tk
```

**For Arch-based systems (EndeavourOS):**
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg python-pip tk
```

---

#### **Step 3: Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**
Setting up a virtual environment (venv) ensures that the program's dependencies do not interfere with system-wide Python packages.

1. **Navigate to the extracted repository directory:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/ultimatevocalremovergui
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - For **Debian-based and Arch-based systems:**
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install dependencies in the virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

#### **Step 4: Run the Application**
While the virtual environment is activated, start the application:
```bash
python UVR.py
```

---

#### **Important Notes**
1. **Avoid Modifying System Files:**  
   Previous instructions suggested deleting the `/usr/lib/python3.11/EXTERNALLY-MANAGED` file, which is dangerous and can break Python package management. Do **NOT** delete this file.

2. **Why Use Virtual Environments?**  
   Virtual environments isolate the program's dependencies, preventing conflicts with system Python packages. More information is available [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75602063/pip-install-r-requirements-txt-is-failing-this-environment-is-externally-mana/75696359#75696359).

### Other Application Notes
- GPUs with at least 8GBs of V-RAM are recommended.
- This application is only compatible with 64-bit platforms. 
- This application relies on the Rubber Band library for the Time-Stretch and Pitch-Shift options.
- This application relies on FFmpeg to process non-wav audio files.
- The application will automatically remember your settings when closed.
- Conversion times will significantly depend on your hardware. 
- These models are computationally intensive. 

### Performance:
- Model load times are faster.
- Importing/exporting audio files is faster.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- If FFmpeg is not installed, the application will throw an error if the user attempts to convert a non-WAV file.
- Memory allocation errors can usually be resolved by lowering the "Segment" or "Window" sizes.

#### MacOS Sonoma Left-click Bug
There's a known issue on MacOS Sonoma where left-clicks aren't registering correctly within the app. This seems to be impacting all applications built with Tkinter on Sonoma.

Temporary solutions:
- Ensure you move your mouse slightly when left-clicking within the application; this ensures the left-click is registered.
- I'm developing a temporary fix that lets you use the middle mouse button or space bar as substitutes for left-clicks until the issue is fully resolved.

This issue is being tracked [here](https://github.com/Anjok07/ultimatevocalremovergui/issues/840).

### Issue Reporting
